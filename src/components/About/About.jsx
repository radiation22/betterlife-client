        Betterlife365 was founded in 2021 to remove the traditional barriers to
        therapy and make mental health care more accessible to everyone. Today,
        it is the world’s largest therapy service — providing professional,
        affordable, and personalized therapy in a convenient online format.
        BetterHelp’s network of over 30,000 licensed therapists has helped
        millions of people take ownership of their mental health and work
        towards their personal goals. As the unmet need for mental health
        services continues to grow, BetterHelp is committed to expanding access
        to therapy globally.
